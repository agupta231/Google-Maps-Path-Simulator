# Google Maps Path Simulator
Are you thinking of biking to work, school, or something else? However, are you like me and
don't want to go on a 21-mile round trip after not working out for a year? 

This script will take your trip from Google Maps and convert into a format that you can take
to a stationary bike to give your path a "test round". It's a lot better to find out that
you aren't cut out for the workout in the gym rather than on the side of the road 6 miles
from home.
